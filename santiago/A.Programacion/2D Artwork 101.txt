Perhaps you want to make games, create animations, or VFX for film.
 Perhaps you want to create concept art, or simply create for your own pleasure.
 Whether you're working with 2D or 3D art, it's important to have a grounding in the rules and basic techniques.
 With that in mind, we asked Derek Stevens to create a series that anyone can follow.
 Our goal is to help you see the world, both inner and outer, by the rules of art.
 Over the course of the next two hours, Derek will demonstrate bringing your visions to life.
 From simple shapes to still life and perspective, all you have to do is follow the rules.
 And of course, remember how to get to Carnegie Hall. Practice, practice, practice!

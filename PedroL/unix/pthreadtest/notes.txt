TO USE THREADS IN C
  Include pthread.h
  Define a void* function with a single void* parameter
  Define a struct with the parameters you actually want to pass
    Include field/s to dump the results of the function
  In main,
    Declare a new struct
    Load it with the values you want to pass
    Create a thread for the function and pass it the struct by reference
  In the function,
    Declare a struct pointer and point it to the pointer the function was passed
    Load up local variables with struct pointers
    Load result of the function into result fields of struct with pointers
    Return NULL
  Back in main,
    Declare variable to store result of thread
    Use pthread_join to ???

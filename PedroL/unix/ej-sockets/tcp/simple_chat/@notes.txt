TODO:
    ~~Message log structure~~
    ~~Message push to log procedure~~
    ~~MESSAGE command~~

    ~~More elegant command handling~~

    ~~Update messages procedure
        Server wait for client OK~~
        
    ~~GOODBYE doesnt drop connection~~
    
    ~~openslots is a critical region~~

    Missed specification for UPDATE

    Check that user is initialized before allowing further commands
        (non-zero id? userin->id = MAXUSRS - openslots + 1;)

    Either push_msg_to_log() or send_msg_log() are faulty (probably former)
        server msg: 
        :   1yo 2

        (after sending "MESSAGE yo" and "MESSAGE yo 2")

    Test with more than one user
